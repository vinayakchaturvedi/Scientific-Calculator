Scientific Calculator with DevOps:

This is a Scientific Calculator developed using various devops tools including:
Jenkins, Docker, ansible etc.

Functionalities included:
● Square root function - √x
● Factorial function - x!
● Natural logarithm (base е) - ln(x)
● Power function - x

DevOps Pipeline
The cycle will include -> Once a developer pushes the code onto a code repository CI/CD
pipeline comes into the pictures. A tool named Jenkins will build the code create a Docker
image and will perform deployment operation with the help of Ansible.

Development IDE: Intellij
● Language: JAVA
● SCM – GitHub - ​ https://github.com/vinayakchaturvedi/Scientific-Calculator
● Building and Packaging – Maven
● Docker image -
● https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vinayak96/scientific_calculator
● Continuous Integration – Jenkins
● Continuous Deployment – Ansible
● Continuous Monitoring – ELK Stack

To start the application in Dev/QA/Production host
Execute the below command.
"docker start -ai prod_calc"

ELK-STACK: For continuous monitoring
./bin/elasticsearch
./bin/kibana
.bin/logstash -f scientific_calc.conf

After executing all 3 commands go to: http://localhost:5601/ 
    -- This will lead to Kibana home page and you can start monitoring the application here.
